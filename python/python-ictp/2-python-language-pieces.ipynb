    "The many existing languages can be classified into families based on their model of computation. The top-level division distinguishes between:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **declarative** languages, in which the focus is on **what** the computer is to do and;\n",
    "* **imperative** languages, in which the focus is on **how** the computer should do it.\n",
    "\n",
    "For instance in `SQL` (Structured Query Language) known as a declarative query language, you would specify **what** you want in that way:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "SELECT name, age, sex\n",
    "FROM employee_table\n",
    "WHERE location=\"Trieste\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In example above, you simply specify that you want `name, age, sex` columns from the `employee_table` where `location` column values is equal to `Trieste`. **Declarative** languages are in some sense \"higher level\"; they are more in tune with the programmer's view.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Imperative** languages predominate, however, mainly for performance reasons. In this family, you will find languages like `C` and `Python` among others.\n",
